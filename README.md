# Emergency Room Priority Queue

Starting the program prompts the user to fill in a Patient Intake Form, including the patient's name, age, level of pain, and the reason for their visit:

Completing the Patient Intake Form creates a Patient Record with the patient's arrival time and places them in a priority queue based on their priority level:

Here we see that the queue keeps the highest priority level in the to position and arranges the queue in descending order:
